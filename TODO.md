# AI SDK Chat Library - Outstanding Work

## Status: Core Architecture Complete ‚úÖ

The foundational Zustand-based architecture is implemented and working. The main remaining work is fixing AI SDK v5 integration and polishing the demo.

---

## üö® Critical Fixes (Blocking)

### 1. Fix AI SDK v5 Integration
**Priority: HIGH** | **Complexity: Medium**

The AI SDK v5 has breaking changes from v4. Current issues:

- **Chat Interface**: `useChat` returns `{ sendMessage, messages, status }` not `{ input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit }`
- **Input Management**: Need to use `useCompletion` for input handling OR manage input state separately
- **Message Format**: `sendMessage` expects specific UIMessage format with parts array
- **Transport System**: API routes need to use transport-based architecture

**Files to fix:**
- `src/app/demo/page.tsx` - Update to use correct interface
- `@lib/components/chat/chat-popout.tsx` - Adapt to new AI SDK patterns
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Fix route to work with new transport system

**Research needed:**
- Study AI SDK v5 documentation and examples
- Understand new transport vs. endpoint architecture
- Check if we need `useCompletion` for input or separate state management

### 2. Fix TypeScript Errors
**Priority: HIGH** | **Complexity: Low**

Current TypeScript errors:

```
src/app/api/chat/route.ts(6,21): error TS2345: Argument of type '{ resourceName: string; ... }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
src/app/api/chat/route.ts(135,19): error TS2551: Property 'toDataStreamResponse' does not exist. Did you mean 'toTextStreamResponse'?
src/app/demo/page.tsx(117,11): error TS2322: Type '"data"' is not assignable to type allowed part types
```

**Fix needed:**
- Update Azure OpenAI configuration syntax
- Use correct streaming response method
- Fix UIMessage part types

### 3. Fix Tool Calling Integration
**Priority: HIGH** | **Complexity: Medium**

Current tool system is incomplete:

- `useAIFrontendTool` registers tools in Zustand but AI doesn't see them
- Tool execution happens locally but results don't reach AI
- Need bidirectional tool calling (AI triggers ‚Üí frontend executes ‚Üí result back to AI)

**Implementation needed:**
- Connect Zustand tool registry to AI SDK tools
- Handle tool execution results properly
- Update API route to include frontend tools in AI context

---

## üîß Feature Completion

### 4. Complete Context Sharing
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Complexity: Low**

Context sharing works but needs improvement:

- ‚úÖ `useAIContext` stores data in Zustand without re-renders
- ‚ùå Context not properly sent to AI in new message format
- ‚ùå Context updates don't trigger AI awareness

**Tasks:**
- Fix context serialization in new message format
- Test context updates trigger AI understanding
- Add context change detection

### 5. Implement Focus Management
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Complexity: Medium**

Focus system is partially implemented:

- ‚úÖ `useAIFocus` stores focus items
- ‚úÖ Focus highlights work via ref system
- ‚ùå AI can't actually trigger focus changes
- ‚ùå No visual focus indicators
- ‚ùå Focus context not reaching AI

**Tasks:**
- Add visual focus highlighting (CSS overlays)
- Connect AI tool calls to focus system
- Add focus change animations
- Test AI can highlight specific elements

### 6. Enhanced Tool System
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Complexity: Medium**

Current tools are basic. Need more sophisticated tools:

**Existing tools:**
- ‚úÖ Counter increment/decrement
- ‚úÖ Basic calculator
- ‚ùå Focus/highlight elements (not working)

**Additional tools needed:**
- Form manipulation (fill inputs, select options)
- Page navigation (scroll to elements)
- State inspection (query current app state)
- Dynamic component creation

### 7. Error Handling & Loading States
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Complexity: Low**

Currently minimal error handling:

**Needed:**
- Proper error boundaries in chat components
- Tool execution error handling
- Network error recovery
- Loading states for tool execution
- Toast notifications for errors

## üé® Polish & Performance

### 8. Ensure Zero Unnecessary Renders
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Complexity: Low**

Need to verify render optimization promises:

**Testing needed:**
- Add React DevTools Profiler testing
- Verify Zustand selectors prevent re-renders
- Test context updates don't cascade
- Benchmark tool registration performance

**Files to audit:**
- All Zustand store files
- Hook implementations
- Chat component tree

### 9. Fix Linting Issues
**Priority: LOW** | **Complexity: Low**

Currently 11,133 linting issues (mostly in node_modules):

**Focus on:**
- Fix `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` in our code
- Fix unused variables
- Fix React display name warnings
- Update Storybook imports

### 10. Add Comprehensive Testing
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Complexity: Medium**

Currently no tests:

**Test suites needed:**
- Zustand store tests (context, tools, focus)
- Hook tests (useAIContext, useAIFrontendTool, useAIFocus)
- Integration tests (tool calling end-to-end)
- Chat component tests
- Performance tests (render counting)

**Tools to use:**
- Vitest (already configured)
- React Testing Library
- Zustand testing utilities

## üì¶ Library Distribution

### 11. Fix Build System
**Priority: LOW** | **Complexity: Low**

Current build works but needs verification:

**Tasks:**
- Test `pnpm run build:lib` creates correct dist/
- Verify all exports work correctly
- Test library in external project
- Check bundle size and tree-shaking

### 12. Add Usage Documentation
**Priority: LOW** | **Complexity: Low**

README is written but not tested:

**Tasks:**
- Test all README examples work
- Add more usage patterns
- Document performance characteristics
- Add migration guide from other chat libraries

### 13. Add Storybook Examples
**Priority: LOW** | **Complexity: Low**

Storybook exists but needs AI integration stories:

**Stories needed:**
- AI context sharing examples
- Tool calling demonstrations
- Focus management examples
- Performance comparison stories

## üî¨ Research & Investigation

### 14. AI SDK v5 Deep Dive
**Priority: HIGH** | **Complexity: Medium**

Need to fully understand new architecture:

**Questions to answer:**
- How does the new transport system work?
- What's the correct way to handle tools?
- How should context be shared?
- What changed in streaming responses?

**Resources:**
- AI SDK v5 documentation
- Migration guides
- Example projects
- Community discussions

### 15. Performance Benchmarking
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Complexity: Medium**

Need to validate "zero unnecessary renders" claim:

**Benchmarks needed:**
- Compare against other chat libraries
- Measure context update performance
- Test with large numbers of tools/focus items
- Memory usage analysis
