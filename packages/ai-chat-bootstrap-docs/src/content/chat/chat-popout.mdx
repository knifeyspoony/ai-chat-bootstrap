# Popout Chat

The <API name="ChatPopout" /> component provides a complete assistant UI with built-in AI chat functionality. It supports overlay and inline modes, left/right positioning, and a draggable resize handle.

<PopoutDocsBlock />

## When to use

- You want a popout version of ChatContainer
- You prefer a panel that can overlay the page or live inline in the layout
- You need resizable width and easy open/close behavior

## Inline vs Overlay

- Inline mode inserts a resizable panel in your layout
- Overlay mode slides in from left/right and can show a backdrop on mobile

```tsx
import { ChatPopout } from "ai-chat-bootstrap";

export function App() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Inline mode */}
      <ChatPopout
        transport={{ api: "/api/chat" }}
        messages={{ systemPrompt: "You are a helpful assistant." }}
        header={{ title: "Assistant" }}
        ui={{ placeholder: "Ask me anything..." }}
        popout={{ mode: "inline", position: "right", width: { default: 420 } }}
      />

      {/* Overlay mode (left) */}
      <ChatPopout
        transport={{ api: "/api/chat" }}
        messages={{ systemPrompt: "You are a helpful assistant." }}
        header={{ title: "Assistant" }}
        ui={{ placeholder: "Ask me anything..." }}
        popout={{ mode: "overlay", position: "left", width: { default: 480, min: 360, max: 640 }, height: "100%" }}
      />
    </>
